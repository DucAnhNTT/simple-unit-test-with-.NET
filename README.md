# Simple Calculator with Unit Tests
This repository contains a simple calculator application built using C# .NET, along with unit tests to ensure the correctness of its functions. The calculator provides basic arithmetic operations and serves as a demonstration of how to apply unit testing to a C# .NET project.

## Features
1. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
2. A user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) built with C# .NET.
3. Unit tests for verifying the correctness of calculator functions.

## Getting Started
These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
1. Visual Studio or any other C# .NET development environment.
2. Clone the Repository
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/calculator.git
### Build and Run
1. Open the project in your C# .NET development environment.
2. Build the solution.
3. Run the application.

## Running the Unit Tests
This project includes unit tests to verify the correctness of the calculator's functions. To run the unit tests:

Open the project in your C# .NET development environment.
In the Test Explorer, you will find a list of unit tests.
Run the tests to ensure the calculator functions correctly.

## Usage
Launch the calculator application.
Use the GUI to perform basic arithmetic operations.
The result will be displayed in the output field.
